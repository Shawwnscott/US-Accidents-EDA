- This EDA project is used to gain practice in analyzing data and tranforming it into something useful. This project will test my understanding of python, NumPY and pandas while increasing my prficiency in it.

- This project followed a tutorial on youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTbavcmd0

- This is a countrywide car accident dataset sourced from KAGGLE, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2021, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data.
